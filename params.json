{"name":"Thermostat","body":"# Thermostat Gem\r\n\r\nThermostat keeps your IceCube humming along nicely.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/svs/thermostat.png)](http://travis-ci.org/svs/thermostat)\r\n\r\nIt presents a declarative interface to IceCube and makes it more suitable to be called programmatically. It also has some niceties around handling holidays and so on.\r\nThermostat provides a uniform way to generate a list of dates. It takes care of building an IceCube object with the passed parameters.\r\n \r\ngiven an appropriate inititalizer, the Thermostat#dates method will provide the required dates. It also adjusts dates for holidays\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\ncall it thusly\r\n\r\n```\r\n@sched = Thermostat.new(:start_date => Date.today, :end_date => Date.today+14, :frequency => :weekly, :holidays => {(Date.today + 7) => Date.today + 9})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\noptions are passed as a Hash with the following keys\r\n\r\n```\r\nstart_date\r\nend_date\r\nn\r\nfrequency   -> one of :daily, :weekly, :biweekly, :quadweekly, :monthly, :bimonthly, :quarterly, :semiannually \r\n              or alternatively a Hash of {:period => :monthly, :every => 4}\r\ndays        -> WEEKDAY element(s) to constrain schedules. if not specified, defaults to start_date.weekday where appropriate\r\nweekly_off  -> a WEEKDAY element\r\nholidays    ->  a Hash of the type {:holiday_date => :date_to_replace_with}\r\n```\r\n\r\none of end_date or n must be specified\r\n\r\nSee the specs for more usage examples\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Declarative interface to IceCube","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
